# PWM Power Modulation
# duty cycle is the % of time the pulse is high


# all have the same frequency in the diagram above
# 50hz = 20ms clock period
# motor can't change that fast so it takes the average voltage, as if it is an analog signal controlling the analog device
# increasing duty cycle increases perceived voltage

# Servo Motor = motors whose rotation angle can be precisely controlled

#50Hz frequency is normal
#1ms width - 0 degrees
#2ms width = 180 degrees
#Same interface is used for remote control; receiver sends PWM to control interfaces (for instance quad copter, even tho they dont have servos)

# Servo Motor Wiring
3 wires
     # power (red)
     # Ground (black)
     # signal (white or yellow)

PWM applied to signal wire
Power should supply sufficient current

External power supply should be used
     ~5 Volts

Raspberry Pi cannot supply enough current to drive typical motors
     ~1 Amp

External supply has power and ground wires
     Wire external power wire to Servo power wire
     External ground wired to Raspberry Pi ground ("common ground")


Only pins 12 and 24 (BOARD numbering) can produce PWM signals

Resistor might be used to isolate pins from servo
